# How to monetize your blog

1. {{<link href="#1-running-ads" name="Running ads">}}
2. {{<link href="" name="Affiliate marketing">}}
3. {{<link href="" name="Sponsorships">}}

# 1. Running ads

Running ads on your site should be your first order of business as you don't even need to make any content. This process is typically a plug and play experience. There are a few adverisor networks you can choose from and you can certainly use more than one.

1. Google Adsense
2. Amazon Associates
3. AdThrive

# 2. Affiliate marketing

Affiliate marketing works as follows. You find a product or service to promote, you get a personalized link for said product, anytime someone buys said product through your link you make a commision. You are essentially being paid by a company to aquire customers. You can find affiliate programs through places like ClickBank or just type in the name of a brand in your niche followed by affiliate to google to see if they have an affiliate program.

# 3. Sponsored products

Getting sponsors shouldn't be the first thing you try to do after launching your blog as you will almost certainly be turned down by everyone of them. A sponsorship can differ from affiliate marketing if the business is going to pay you just for you having talked about their product or service. This type of monetization is going to be reserved for blogs that are well established and have consistently high traffic. With that said these will likely be the highest paying as brands will pay thousands to get their products seen by so many people.
