# W﻿hat is a Micro-SaaS?

A﻿ Micro-SaaS typically focuses on solving one key problem in a specific niche. Typically they take little funding to start and very little resources to build. This has made them a very hot topic amongst entrepreneurial developers as of late. Revenue is often generated by one-time fees or a recurring subscription model.

# W﻿ho should start a Micro-SaaS business?

M﻿icro-SaaS products can be built by anyone but those who benefit the most from this sort of business model are

1. P﻿eople who lack funding
2. D﻿evelopers who currently have a day job and are looking to break away from the 9-5 life
3. D﻿eveolopers looking to add to their portfolio

T﻿hese are just a few examples but the moral of the story is if you have a solution to a problem in a niche you are familiar with, you should consider building a Micro-SaaS.
