# 1. Good SEO

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and it's goal is to make your website more readable to a search engine which will help you gain more traffic.

Google will rank your page for a users search based on how relevant the content on your site or page is to it. This is why when you type things in to google you usually find what you are looking for in the first few links.

There are a few forms of SEO to mention here:

1. Local SEO
2. On-page SEO
3. Technical SEO
4. Off-page SEO

Local SEO refers to people in your local area looking you up. So if you are a barber and people in your area are looking for a barber google is more likely to recommend you.

On-page SEO refers to your web-pages and the content on them. So things like written content, titles, keywords, etc. will affect your on-page SEO. A good free to use tool to audit your on-page SEO is {{<link href="#" name="semrush">}}.

Technical SEO comes down to things like performance, best practices, etc. It is important that your page performs well otherwise people aren't going to want to stay very long.

Off-page SEO refers to factors outside of your website that affect SEO. You may have heard of backlinks a some point; this is that type of SEO. DISCLAIMER: PLEASE DON'T GO BUYING BACKLINKS! YOUR SITE WILL GET PENALIZED IN RANKING HEAVILY!

It is important to nail these to the best of your ability. Of course some of them are mostly out of your hands like local and off-page SEO but the moral of the story is to create really good content that people want to consume.

# 2. Social Media

Social media is a great place to continue to build your audience for your website or blog. Itâ€™s a great way to diversify.

If you are already making consistent content for your brand through something like a blog, consider posting it in short-form on social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. This is also another way to increase the inbound links to your site. You can use a site like Canva to create a nice cover for the post so people are more likely to click.

The great thing about social media is that your audience is mostly uncapped, you driving more traffic to your brand, and in a way you are building a totally new brand with a largely new audience.

If you aren't at the very least doing this I strongly suggest you do so as a strong social media presence is worth its weight in gold in today's age

# 3. Paid ad campaigns

Paid ad campaigns or paid traffic are when you pay a network or publisher (etc.) to promote your brand for you. Examples of platforms like this are:

- Facebook Ads
- Google Ads
- Tik Tok Ads
- Instagram Ads

The list of places to advertise doesn't end there though. You can also look to more well known publishers in your niche and have what is called a sponsored post. This is when your content will appear on their site as if it is their own content, but it actaully links back to your page. Both can be extremely valuable although if you are looking for an extremely targeted ad campaign for not too much work or cash; then running your ads on a well know platform will be just fine for you.

One thing to keep in mind when running paid ads is ensuring that what ever you link to on your site is going to make you more money than you are paying for the ad itself.

# Conclusion

There are a ton of ways to gain traffic both free and paid, and these are just a few. If you want to run a successful online you need to be doing everything you can to drive more traffic so even if you are unable to do the pay to play actions; you should still be trying to move the needle.

If you haven't done so already get out there and make a social account for your business. Start building reputation and authority in your niche and I assure you it will pay off in the long term.
