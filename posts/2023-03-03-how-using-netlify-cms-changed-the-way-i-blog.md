I just added Netlify CMS to my Hugo blog and assuming this post works it has been a major improvement.

#﻿ Why you should add Netlify CMS to your SSG

1. {{<link href="#no-more-vs-code" name="I used to use VS Code to edit all MD files">}}

#﻿ No More VS Code

Hopefully this spells the end of me editing blog posts in VS Code and I can use Netlify CMS to Manage all of my content. Look forward to more regular blogging but for today we are just writing a simple test blog. Thank you!
